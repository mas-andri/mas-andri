## About Me

Hi, I'm **Margono Andri Hastiko**, and I'm on an exciting journey to begin my career as a Software Quality Assurance.
Although I don’t have professional work experience in SQA yet, I have been actively learning through online courses on platforms like Udemy, where I gained knowledge about testing concepts, methodologies, and tools. I also completed a Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp at Binar Academy, which gave me hands-on experience in web development and a strong understanding of the software development lifecycle.
Previously, I worked as a store crew and cleaning service staff. While those jobs were outside the tech field, they helped me develop valuable skills such as discipline, responsibility, problem-solving, teamwork and I believe are valuable in SQA work.
I am eager to keep learning, sharpen my skills, and contribute to building reliable, high-quality software as I begin this new career path in SQA.

These experiences gave me a strong foundation to start my journey in Software Quality Assurance.
